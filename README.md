Brain MRI Tumor Detection Web App
This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload MRI images and receive predictions on whether the image contains a tumor or not. The app uses a VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that has been fine-tuned for brain MRI classification.

Introduction
This project aims to help in the detection of brain tumors by analyzing MRI scans. The web application allows users to upload an MRI image, which is then processed by a deep learning model to predict whether a tumor is present or not. The project uses Streamlit to create a simple, interactive user interface.

Features
Upload MRI images (JPG, JPEG, PNG) through a web interface.
Predict whether a brain tumor is present using a fine-tuned VGG16 model.
Display the result along with the uploaded image.
Confidence score based on the model's predictions.
Simple and intuitive interface powered by Streamlit.
Model Information
The model used in this project is a VGG16 CNN fine-tuned for binary classification (Tumor/No Tumor). The model has been trained and tested on a dataset of brain MRI images and has achieved the following metrics:

Accuracy: 81.48%
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.85
F1-Score: 0.85
The model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the last 10 layers and adding custom layers for classification.

How to Run the App
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
pip for installing dependencies
Streamlit for running the app
Install Dependencies
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-mri-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-mri-tumor-detection
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the App
Ensure your trained model file (best_vgg16_model.h5) is in the project directory.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to use the app.

Usage
Launch the app via the command line as described above.
Upload an MRI image by selecting a file (JPG, JPEG, PNG format).
Wait for the model to process the image and display the prediction.
If a tumor is detected, the app will show "Tumor Detected".
If no tumor is detected, it will show "No Tumor Detected".

Future Improvements
Grad-CAM Visualization: Provide users with insights into which parts of the MRI image were most influential in making the prediction.
Threshold Tuning: Allow users to adjust the decision threshold to balance precision and recall based on specific use cases.
Multi-Image Upload: Enable batch processing of MRI images.
Mobile Support: Enhance the user interface for better usability on mobile devices.

Additional Notes:
Be sure to update the repository URL in the clone command and any other links to match your repository.
Ensure you have the model file (best_vgg16_model.h5) saved in the correct directory when users clone or run the project.
